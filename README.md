# Help for Ukrainian refugees

This project and resulting progessive web application should enable
the refugees to find quickly a place where they can get shelter and
some rest.

## Deployment

Currently the placeholder application is hosted
[https://ukrainian-refugees.org](https://ukrainian-refugees.org/).

## What is the purpose of that application?

This application should primarily help refugees to find shelter in
neighboring countries. The refugees and their security needs are the
main drivers for this project. Ideally each language of neighboring
countries can be offered, of course the main one needs to Ukrainian.

Refugees should feel safe to enter their contact information without
being in danger of being chased or pursued after fleeing in a
foreign country.

That means, no data is being revealed unless the person or group has
granted a mutual data exchange, like assigning a private housing
offering.

The application needs to work perfectly in a mobile network with low
bandwidth or in some later versions purely with text messages. Hence
the UI needs to be as small as possible, little to no client-side
code execution and as little remoting as possible.

## Future goals

Showing a map, based on district level aggregation, where available
housing is displayed could be a useful extension.

Also finding family members or friends across (Eastern) Europe is
one of the next milestones.

## Application under development

This application is - sadly :( - not yet ready to be used, but under
ACTIVE development! To get updates subscribe to the GitHub project

project and share your ideas.

A detailed documentation how to actively - aka. contributing code - is
not yet ready. Stay tuned, star and subscribe to the project!
